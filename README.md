# go_online
This FLUTTER package provides a `GoOnline` class that can be used to make HTTP requests to a RESTful API. The class is designed to simplify the process of sending HTTP requests by abstracting away the implementation details of the `http` package.  The `GoOnline` class has methods for sending `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests to an API. The base URL of the API can be set using the `url` property, and the `getToken()` method can be used to retrieve an authentication token from the device's `SharedPreferences`.  The `postData()` method sends a `POST` request to the API with some data, while the `getData()` method sends a `GET` request. The `updateData()` and `deleteData()` methods send `PUT` and `DELETE` requests respectively.  The `GoOnline` class also sets the required headers for the requests, including the `Content-type`, `Accept`, and `Authorization` headers. The `Content-type` and `Accept` headers are set to `application/json`, and the `Authorization` header includes the authentication token.  Overall, this package provides a convenient and easy-to-use way of sending HTTP requests to a RESTful API, making it ideal for use in Flutter projects that need to communicate with a server.
